                    <h4>In this first group project, I had been set with the tast to create my first 'proper' 3D game,
                        the brief being to create a game that in some way would teach kids to preserve energy. In our
                        particular project, we had decided to go through with making the main preservation through
                        transportation, the aim of the game to make children favour a more environmentally friendly mode
                        of transport in comparison to items that need fuel.</h4>

    <h2>
        The character
    </h2>
    <p>
        We decided our character was going to represent the audience playing the game, the way of moving through the
        game to gather environmentally-friendly ideas of fuel such as apples and rewarding the user in comparison to the
        playing picking up the fuel tanks and ultimately their energy falling more rapidly.
