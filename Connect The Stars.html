                    <h4>In this third group project, I had been tasked to create an interactive game with a set of
                        briefs to choose from. In this particular project, however, we were set to create a touch screen
                        interactive game to educate children on space and constellations, the idea that they solve a
                        dot-to-dot puzzle, complete a question based off what constellation you had just created, and
                        then move onto the next image, difficulty increasing as you go.</h4>

    <h2>
        The Game
    </h2>
    <p>
        Although our game specifically is touch screen, our other options we had debated were to make it in a form where
        you as a player could feel like you were in space, a 3d element making it able to rotate a planet and view
        things from all sorts of perspectives. This idea ultimately was not chosen due to complications on creation.
