        <h4>In this third group project, I had been tasked to create an interactive game with a set of briefs to choose from. In this particular project, however, we were set to create a touch screen interactive game to educate children on space and constellations, the idea that they solve a dot-to-dot puzzle, complete a question based off what constellation you had just created, and then move onto the next image, difficulty increasing as you go.</h4>

    	<h2>
    		The Game
    	</h2>
    	<p>
    		Although our game specifically is touch screen, our other options we had debated were to make it in a form where you as a player could feel like you were in space, a 3d element making it able to rotate a planet and view things from all sorts of perspectives. This idea ultimately was not chosen due to complications on creation.
