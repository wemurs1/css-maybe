                    <h3>In this second group project, I had been set with the task to create an item that would in some
                        form fit our audience target. In this particular project, we created a knife with the ability to
                        collect points in order to lessen your grocery shopping struggles with an inbuilt feature to
                        detect motion to level up every time you use it.</h3>

        The app/how it works
    </h2>
    <p>
        The app itself is designed to link to the tool to remind users to use the item and level up with each usage to
        unlock discounts and tokens for local grocery stores. Through this, the gamification aspect works to encourage
        people to cook more frequently to hopefully make users more healthy and send them recipes that are cheap and
        easy to follow.
